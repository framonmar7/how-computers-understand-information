# How Computers Understand Information  
**Understanding how data becomes information inside a computer.**

---

## 1. Introduction  

When we think of a computer, we usually picture a machine capable of doing many things at once — running programs, displaying images, playing music, or connecting to the Internet. Yet behind all that apparent complexity lies a simple idea: a digital system does not understand the world as we do. It doesn’t recognize sounds, words, or colors on its own; it can only work with data represented in a form it can interpret.  

A software engineer must first understand **how information is represented inside the system**. Otherwise, programming becomes a purely mechanical activity, disconnected from the reality of what actually happens when a program runs or when a file is saved. The goal of this first topic is not to teach electronics, but to explore the starting point of all computing: how real-world data is transformed into a format that machines can process with precision.  

You can think of a computer as someone who follows instructions only when they’re written in their own language. When we ask it to perform an operation or display text, what we are really doing is translating our ideas into a set of symbols that it can understand. This translation is possible thanks to a set of mathematical and logical conventions that allow **any kind of information** — a number, a word, an image, or a sound — to be expressed using only a few basic symbols.  

For example, if we wanted to save the sentence “Hello world” on a computer, each letter would first need to be converted into a form the system can interpret. The same happens with a photograph, a song, or even a program instruction: everything the computer manipulates must be transformed into an organized sequence of data. That organization doesn’t arise by chance; it follows specific rules that we will study in this module.  

The purpose of this introductory block is therefore to understand **what “information” means for a machine**, and how it can store and process it. In the following sections, we will explore the different numeral systems, see how data can be expressed in multiple ways depending on the context, and discover how these representations form the foundation upon which all software is ultimately built.
